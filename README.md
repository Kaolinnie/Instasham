# Instasham :star:

# Description :notebook:
We created a web application similar to instagram to demonstrate our understanding of Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern and to showcase our overall knowledge in web development.

# Learning Objectives :mag:

- Use and destroy session variables, especially for the Login/Logout process.
- Implement and use Action Filters to restrict user access to secure functionality.
- Manipulate database records to reflect typical eCommerce Web app interactions.
- Manage file uploads and serve files.
Further understand how to:
- Implement a PHP MVC (Model View Controller) Web application.
- Use method parameters and session variables for integrity constraints and data input requirements in Web 
applications.
- Implement multi-table databases.
- Use PDO and appropriate SQL to interact with this database.
